<h4><div class="b">You are tasked with building the system architecture of a multirotor. It has to be capable of carrying an Autopilot (flight controller), a Telemetry Radio, a GPS and any other devices you deem fit. The first step is to make a small test drone in which the flight controller, radios and software is checked. This vehicle has to be capable of sustaining a 20 min flight and reach a maximum height of 140 feet. Assume the mechanical assembly to be fit and robust.</div></h4>
<h3 id="submissions-and-design-rationale">Submissions and Design Rationale:</h3>
<p><strong>Submission - 1) 
A flowchart depicting the system architecture of the test multirotor (eg. given). To be submitted as a PDF. Suitable templates may be used.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Power, Motor Control and Transmission lines to be marked in separate colors and labelled appropriately.</li>
<li>All devices to be supplied with<br>
lables.</li>
<li>Transmission Frequency, Battery Voltage etc. to be included.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submission - 2) A component list of all hardware (eg. battery, motors, props, esc, autopilotâ€¦) to be used (excluding the mechanical frame) on the vehicle. To be submitted as an excel sheet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Name, Price and Purchase link of each device to be included.</li>
<li>Only LiPO battery to be used.</li>
<li>Indian vendors to be preferred.</li>
<li>Out of Stock components not allowed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Drone:</h2>
<div class="b">Now that the test drone has performed successfully, you are tasked with making a power supply for the real drone.</div>
<p><strong>Submission - 3) Power Distribution Board for the Motors, Autopilot and Telemetry radio. The board is to be designed around the TI TPS5431 buck converter ICs (<a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TPS5431">Information</a>) to power the autopliot and radio.</strong></p>

<p><strong>To be submitted as a PCB in KiCAD or EAGLE( schematic and board layout) along with Bill of Materials (in excel format).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Design Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The PCB should be capable of handling <strong>100-150A</strong> continuously.</li>
<li>The <strong>high current path</strong> (to motors) and <strong>low current paths</strong> (to autopilot, radio etc) should be as isolated from each other as possible.</li>
<li>The motors and the input to the buck regulator should be at the same voltage.</li>
<li>Proper grounding techniques to be used.</li>
<li>A current sensor and voltage sensor capable of measuring <strong>maximum current and voltage</strong> to be included.</li>
<li>Compatible <strong>Connectors and Cables</strong> to be identified for each piece of hardware.</li>
</ul>
